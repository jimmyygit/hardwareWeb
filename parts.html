					<p class="text"> Right off at first glance you will probably see and large
					piece of a green board, this piece of hardware is called the motherboard. This 
					is the piece which keeps everything together and connected. It is like a road 
					for other hardware to communicate to each other and send data throughout. 
					It holds the CPU, memory like RAM and ROM, power connection, and other 
					elements that may be needed to operate the computer. Not only does it connect 
					the hardware inside the computer, it also has ports on the motherboard that 
					allow peripherals to be connected and communicate with the computer as input.
					Most of the input is then processed through the CPU. The copper material used 
					for the motherboard is ideal because of its conductive property which is superb in 
					transferring data. Below is a picture of the motherboad.</p>

					<h2 id="power" class="subHead"> <a class="black" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_supply"> Power Supply </a> </h2>
					<p class="text"> When disassembling our computer, we were unable to take out our
					power supply. The problem was that the screws were in spots where a screwdriver
					wouldn't reach. Anyways, the power supply is exactly what it sounds like. It 
					supplies power to the computer. It takes AC and changes it into low-voltage DC 
					for parts of the computer to use. The unit regulates the voltage to an adequate
					amount, which allows the computer to function smoothly. Since this part of the 
					computer is the first to receive electricity, it is the most vulnerable to power 
					surges, spikes, blowouts, etc. Therefore in addition to regulating power for other 
					hardware, it is also built to handle fluctuations in electricity. As many pieces of
					hardware do, these units can overheat. The logical solution being, to attach a fan.
					In our case, the fan at the top was connected to our power supply unit. 
					Below is a picture of the power supply. </p>

					<h2 id="ram" class="subHead"> <a class="black" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory"> RAM </a> </h2>
					<p class="text"> Random Access Memory (RAM) is a form of computer data storage which
					stores frequently used program instructions to increase the general speed of a system.
					A random-access memory device allows data items to be read or written in almost the same 
					amount of time irrespective of the physical location of data inside the memory. How it works
					is relatively simple. Imagine you are looking for your friend in a building. This is serial
					access, you start at room one and go to room two, three, four etc., until you get to the room 
					where your friend is. It’s an exhausting way of finding something but if you know which floor 
					and number then you can go straight there. It’s called random access because it can go all over
					the place and don’t have to go in order. So RAM is a grid of storage locations for data and instructions. 
					While a program is running, it is constantly being read and changed, meaning in order for your computer 
					to work quickly, you would need fast RAM and lots of it. Below is a picture of a RAM chip. </p>

					<h2 id="rom" class="subHead"> <a class="black" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD-ROM"> CD-ROM </a> </h2>
					<p class="text"> CD-ROM stands for Compact Disc, read only memory. CD-ROMs are optical 
					compact discs which are commonly used to store data and transfer it across physical 
					locations from reading site to reading site. Most CD-ROMs employ 2 different laser beams
					(one for DVD one for CD). A diode inside the laser assembly emits a laser beam, which is
					focused through a lens. Scaling the laser's power to different levels allows the drive to
					read discs (using a low power setting) or write them (at high power). The discs themselves
					are thin tough layers of polycarbonate, a plastic. The surface of the disc is layered with 
					microscopic pits that represent data, usually arranged in a spiral formation. The reading 
					laser beam scatters when it hits a pit in the spiral. When the beam lands, and the flat spots
					between the pits are called, it bounces back into a pickup in the laser assembly. The drive
					electronics then translate the pit-land data stream/ratio into binary which will then be turned 
					into accessible bytes of data. Below is a picture of the CD-ROM.  </p>

					<h2 id="hard" class="subHead"> <a class="black" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_disk_drive"> Hard Drive </a> </h2>
					<p class="text"> Usually near the edges of the computer you will find a small rectangular 
					box with a circuit board attached to one side, this is called a hard disk drive. The hard drive is the 
					computer's long term memory which uses magnetic states on several disks to store permanent information.
					This type of memory is non-volatile which means that even though the computer isn't provided with power,
					the information within the hard drive still remains. If you are writing to the hard drive and the computer
					does shut down, the information may get corrupted because it hasn't fully written and saved all your information.
					On these disks, there are many magnetic states that can either represent a 0 or 1 which the computer can read as 
					binary. Hovering over the disks are magnetic heads that are able to do this task in converting the magnetic state
					to binary. This magnetic head is also able to write to these disk in the magnetic state it needs to be in. Since
					the hard drive has moving parts, it is much slower in reading and writing data to it, so other types of memory
					like RAM are more ideal for faster memory as it doesn't use any moving parts. Below is a picture of the hard disk drive. </p>

					<h2 id="floppy" class="subHead"> <a class="black" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floppy_disk"> Floppy Drive </a> </h2>
					<p class="text"> The floppy disk drive is something that has nearly disappeared. Few people nowadays 
					know what one is. Basically speaking, a floppy disk drive is an older, bigger version of a USB. This means 
					an FDD reads on writes data to a small disk. A floppy disk drive was one of the first forms of portable storage.
					Today as technology has advanced we call our USBs, thumb drives, because that's how big they are. The floppy disk
					drive can be on the outside or inside of a computer. In our case, it was on the inside. Floppy disks work in a 
					similar way to cassettes and the magnetic strip on credit cards. When storing info on the drive, a head manipulates 
					the magnetic coating on the drive. When reading, the computer reads the magnetic coating, converts it into binary,
					then into whatever language it's set in. Before recording a special head erases the drive, in order for the drive
					to be written on again. Below is a picture of the floppy disk drive. </p>

					<h2 id="cpu" class="subHead"> <a class="black" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit"> CPU </a> </h2>
					<p class="text"> CPU stands for Central Processing Unit (also known as a microprocessor) often called the “brain”
					of the computer. Its is the electronic circuitry within a computer that carries out the instructions of a computer
					program by performing the basic arithmetic, logical, control and input/output operations specified by the instructions. 
					Most CPUs are synchronous circuits, which means they employ a clock signal to pace their sequential operations.
					The clock gives a pulse to the CPU like a drum beat to march to, to keep things in order. Nearly all modern CPUs 
					represent numbers in binary form, using only 1s and 0s to represent information.
					As you use your computer, the processor starts generating a lot of heat which is caused by the internal electrical
					energy of the components, and gets warmer the harder the components have to work. Improper maintenance of heat and 
					overheating of the processor can reduce the lifespan or cause irreparable damage to the components in the processor,
					including components like circuits, microchips, RAM, or hard drives, and makes the computer inoperable. In order to 
					avoid damaging the components and prevent loss of data, it becomes essential to have good cooling equipment like a CPU 
					fan. The CPU fan is critically necessary to ventilate the heat generated from the components, and actively cools the 
					processor by bringing in the cooler air before the heat damages the computer components.
					A heat sink is a passive heat exchanger that transfers the heat generated by the CPU to a fluid medium, often air or a 
					liquid coolant, where it is dissipated away from the device, thereby allowing regulation of the device's temperature at 
					optimal levels. In computers, heat sinks are used to cool central processing units or graphics processors. A heat sink is 
					usually made out of copper and/or aluminium. Copper is used because it has many desirable properties for thermally efficient 
					and durable heat exchangers. Below is a picture of the CPU, the CPU's fan and the heat sink. </p>

					<h2 id="bios" class="subHead"> <a class="black" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BIOS"> BIOS </a> </h2>
					<p class="text"> BIOS stands for Basic Input/Output System. It is the program that a 
					computer’s microprocessor uses to get the computer system started after you turn it on.
					This program also manages the flow of data between a computer’s operating system and other
					devices such as the hard disk, keyboard, and printer. BIOS functions by first identifying and then
					testing all the hardware components (including the hard disk and floppy drives). Finally, it locates
					another valid operating system to which it can transfer control. Unlike most hardware pieces, the BIOS is
					hooked up with a battery because it needs to retain its information even when the computer is off so it
					can operate until the computer is on. Below is a picture of the BIOS. </p>

					<h2 id="expansion" class="subHead"> <a class="black" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expansion_card"> Expansion Cards </a> </h2>
					<p class="text"> Somewhere along the motherboard you may see some slots that are long and 
					narrow where are card can be inserted into, these are your expansion slots where you can 
					insert various types of cards to add more capabilities to your computer. Examples of expansion
					cards could include, graphic/video, sound, modem or a network card. All these will allow the computer
					to have more potential. Today, most computers you can purchase already come pre-installed with these 
					cards, but there is also room for improvement for anyone wanting to buy more advanced cards, like graphics
					cards. Most expansion cards today are usually locked into what is called the PCI slot because it is able
					to handle the rapid and large amounts of data travelling throughout the computer. Below is a picture of the expansion
					card that allows for more expansion slots. </p>

					<h2 id="interact" class="subHead" title="eyy you found the easter egg"> How Parts Interact </h2>
					<p class="text"> When first starting up and powering on your computer, the electricity connected to the computer
					is carried into the power supply where is distributes the voltages needed for each part of the computer. After all 
					the components are ready to use and powered on, the BIOS comes into play. The BIOS is what tells
					the computer what to do and makes sure that all the hardware in the computer is working. Once you 
					are on the desktop of your computer you can roam around and do anything you want. All of your saved programs 
					and files are saved on the hard drive and those programs may use the RAM memory to operate. All of the information 
					is processed through the CPU in binary and carries out the commands and tasks that it has been instructed to do. 
					Most of the travelling information is carried out through the printed tracks on the motherboard and allows 
					for the hardware pieces to communicate, just like how the CPU receives data from RAM. There is also your removable
					memory that the CPU also interacts with to read and write information from and to it. There may also be some
					expansion cards on the motherboard that provide the computer with more capabilities and also interact with the 
					CPU through the motherboard. It is because of all of these interactive components that ultimately make the computer
					function the way is does today. </p>
